# DC Motor Control with PID

This project demonstrates how to control two DC motors using position encoding and PID control. The implementation is step-by-step, with several test files included to ensure functionality along the way. The main code files for the project are attached in this repository.

## Demonstration Video

I have created a YouTube video demonstrating the DC motor control using PID. Watch the video for a detailed explanation and live demonstration of the project.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to control two DC motors with precision using PID control. The key features include:

- **Position Encoding**: Tracking the position of the motors for accurate control.
- **PID Control**: Implementing PID algorithms to maintain desired motor positions.
- **Step-by-Step Testing**: Various test files are provided to verify each part of the implementation.

## Code Files

The following are the main code files included in this project:

1. **PID_control_for_2DC.ino**: Main implementation file for controlling two DC motors using PID.
2. **encoder_testing_2dc.ino**: Test file for verifying the encoder functionality with two DC motors.
3. **dc_motor_test_2dc.ino**: Test file for basic DC motor operations.
